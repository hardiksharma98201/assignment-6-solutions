1. Square root of vectors is a more expensive operation than vector addition and
multiplication.

2. Make a CUDA program that computes the square root of A[i] and stores the results in
C[i].

3. Run it using 50,000; 500,000; 5,000,000; and 50,000,000 array elements. As before,
record the timings for each of these in your spreadsheet, and create charts to help us
visualize the results.
